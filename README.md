Codecademy JS project on checking if a fictional credit card number is valid based on Luhn algorithm.

The program is able to process the numbers input as either nested arrays, undefined (no data), strings or numbers, finds incorrect numbers and returns them as strings, identifies credit card companies issuing incorrect numbers and proposes a new number where the last digit is altered to pass the Luhn algorithm (returns it as string).
